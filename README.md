# domain-extractor
The system allows you to extract valid domains from text that you type, paste, or upload from a .txt file. After processing the data, it displays the extracted domains, separated by commas, in a results box. The user can copy the domains to the clipboard, with a confirmation after copying. The interface is responsive and modern.
